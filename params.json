{"name":"Trevor L. McDonell","tagline":"Lambda scientist, physicist at heart. Cyclist. Coffee enthusiast.","body":"### About Me\r\n\r\nI am currently a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [School of Informatics and Computing](http://www.soic.indiana.edu/) and the [Center for Research in Extreme Scale Technologies](https://www.crest.iu.edu/) at [Indiana University Bloomington, USA](http://iu.edu/). My interests include parallel programming (in particular, data parallelism), functional programming languages, and using graphics processors and other compute accelerators.\r\n\r\nI completed my PhD with the [Programming Languages and Systems](http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/~pls/PLS/PLS.html) group in the [School of Computer Science and Engineering](http://www.cse.unsw.edu.au/) at the [University of New South Wales, Australia](http://www.unsw.edu.au/).\r\n\r\nI was previously a student at the [University of Sydney, Australia](http://www.usyd.edu.au/), where I studied Mechatronics (Space) at the [Australian Centre for Field Robotics (ACFR)](http://www.acfr.usyd.edu.au/) (with honours) together with Physics and Computational Science at the [School of Physics](http://www.physics.usyd.edu.au/). I also had a brief encounter with [ViSLAB](http://www.vislab.net/) and the [Centre for Quantum Computer Technology (CQCT)](http://www.cqc2t.org/) during this time.\r\n\r\nAfter graduating, I held a brief internship at the [Andøya Rocket Range](http://www.rocketrange.no/) (Andøya, Norway). Before returning to academia, I worked as a software engineer for [Canon Information Systems Research Australia (CiSRA)](http://cisra.com.au/) (Sydney, Australia). I also took some time out of my PhD to intern at the [National Institute of Informatics (NII)](http://www.nii.ac.jp/) (Tokyo, Japan) as well as the compilers group of [NVIDIA](http://www.nvidia.com/page/home.html) (Seattle, USA).\r\n\r\nI spend most of my time implementing [Functional Programming Languages](http://www.cs.nott.ac.uk/~pszgmh/faq.html), which I use to program [CUDA](http://www.nvidia.com/object/cuda_home_new.html) graphics cards for general purpose computations ([GPGPU](http://gpgpu.org/)).\r\n\r\nI am a regular at [FP-Syd](http://fp-syd.ouroborus.net/).\r\n\r\nI have been spotted at [various](http://www.bicyclenetwork.com.au/general/great-rides/20005/) [cycling](http://selfpropelled.com.au/event/mont-24/) [events](http://www.gongride.org.au/).\r\n\r\nWhen not doing the above I (occasionally) practice [martial arts](https://www.facebook.com/MizongKungFu).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Publications\r\n\r\n\r\n### Projects\r\n\r\n\r\n### Teaching\r\n","google":"UA-68633942-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
